# 👋 Hey, I'm Amine Jaoued!

## 🚀 About Me  
I'm a passionate full-stack developer who loves building scalable web applications and solving complex problems.  
I specialize in **React.js, Next.js, and Node.js**, crafting seamless user experiences with efficient, maintainable code.  

🏋️‍♂️ When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me doing bodyweight workouts (because why lift weights when you can lift yourself? 😆).  

🌍 Based in **Tunisia** 🇹🇳 | Always learning & pushing my limits.  

💡 Let's build something amazing! 🚀
